3.1
- The NextBus class was really using the Nextbus2 api call all along.  This was pretty confusing, so 2 seperate classes now exist; one for NextBus and NextBus2.  This means any code using NextBus prior to 3.1 will break since it was really calling the Nextbus2 api and we've updated it so the class of matching name is calling the matching api method.
- Dev dependencies of chronic and rspec-instafail were also added to aid testing

3.1.1
- spec updates, and general tidy

3.1.2
- NextBus#stop added
- Contains info about the stop (:side, :stopid, :heading, :lat, :area, :servicetype, :route, :operator)

3.1.3
- Turns out that in the NextBus calls the <service> tag can come back as either a single node or list of nodes.  In one case savon turns this into an array, in the other case it's just a single entity.  Rewrote NextBus.where to handle these two cases, this also means NextBus would never really represent a single service.  Created a NextBus.services method that returns all these entities in a similar manner.  Update test specs

3.1.4
- Bug Fix: NextBus trips returned can be an array or a single hash

3.1.5
- Bug Fix: NextBus where was incorrectly sending Time in 12 hour format when ATIS needs it in 24 hour format.

3.1.6
- Added field 'sign' to Ratis::Timetable::Trip, this is the headsign for a bus running a given trip

3.1.7
- Removed to_hash, instead use better named to_hash_for_xml for use with NextRide SMS service end-point

3.1.8
- Within to_hash_from_xml, pull route and sign attributes from the service instead of the realtime info (they always seem to be blank)

3.2.0
- When querying Nextbus for a Light Rail stop, in most cases you will actually get back 2 stops for a single NextRide ID.  One for each side of the stop platform.  Made changes to handle this case.  Both stops services are flattened into the #services attribute.

3.2.1
- Timetable::Trip now contains the trip's headsign

3.3.5
- Refactored Ratis::Location to be usable in Trip Planner
